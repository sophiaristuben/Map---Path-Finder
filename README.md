Utilizes edge weighted graphs to read a file containing location descriptions on a map and connect them by shortest distance or shortest time. Runs depth first search to find strong connections between vertices and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between a singular vertex with the rest of the vertices.
